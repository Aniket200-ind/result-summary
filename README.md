## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use grid to make the layout of the page. I also learned how to use flexbox to center the elements. I also learned how to use the CSS variables to make the code clean and easy to read. I also learned how to use the media query to make the page responsive. Most importantly, I followed mobile-first approach for this project!!

### Continued development

I would like to lessen the time on designing and css stuff. I would also like to focus more on using proper semantics where needed. I would also like to focus more on the mobile-first approach.
